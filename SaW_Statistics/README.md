## Statistically analysis of the Cas9 targeted-sites
# Running the code will calculate the percentage of editing efficiency from mapped reads and percentage of insertions mutated reads. Graphical representation in Pie-charts. 

The code use the variant table as an input file to calcuate different parametes of a Cas9-targeting experiment. 
A test file is provided in the folder ("test_dataset_statistics.csv"). The table is based on NGS variants plus two additional columns (dublications and microhomologies)
Additionally the user needs to provide a the number of mapped reads which can be extracted from the tsv file.
